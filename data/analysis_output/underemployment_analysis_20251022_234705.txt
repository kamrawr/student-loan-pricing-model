   - STEM and Health fields show lowest risk
   - 3-4x earnings difference between highest/lowest fields

2. COMPLETION RATE GRADIENT:
   - Strong monotonic relationship: higher completion â†’ higher earnings
   - Suggests completion may protect against underemployment scarring

3. SOCIOECONOMIC STRATIFICATION:
