## Executive Summary

This brief proposes **risk-adjusted interest rates** for federal student loans based on academic major and institution quality. Currently, all undergraduate borrowers pay 5.50% regardless of field-specific default risk, creating cross-subsidies where Engineering majors subsidize Philosophy majors by ~0.65 percentage points.

**Key Findings:**
- **Interest rate spread**: 5.85% to 6.17% under pure risk-based pricing (0.32 pp)
- **Monthly payment impact**: $4.74/month difference ($569 over 10 years)
- **Fairness adjustments**: Low-income students receive up to 1.9 pp rate reductions
- **Budget impact**: Revenue-neutral if properly calibrated; could save $2-3B annually in defaults

**Recommendation:** Pilot **hybrid model** combining modest risk premiums (+0 to +0.75 pp) with progressive income subsidies (-0.5 to -2.0 pp) to balance efficiency and equity.

## The Problem

### Current System Issues

1. **Hidden Cross-Subsidies**
   - Low-risk majors (Engineering, 1.3% underemployment) subsidize high-risk majors (Philosophy, 30% underemployment)
   - High-earning graduates pay same rate as struggling borrowers
   - No price signals for career relevance

2. **Misaligned Incentives**
   - Students unaware of default risk when choosing majors
   - Institutions face no consequences for high-risk programs
   - Taxpayers absorb $10B+ annually in defaults

3. **Equity Concerns**
   - Low-income students concentrated in high-risk fields
   - Current "one-size-fits-all" approach masks inequality
   - IBR plans band-aid over structural issues

### Empirical Evidence

**Data Source:** College Scorecard (7,703 institutions, 24 academic fields)

| Field | Median Earnings | Underemployment | Default Risk Estimate |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Engineering | $52,900 | 1.3% | 5.2% |
| Computer Science | $38,800 | 9.2% | 6.9% |
| Business | $35,700 | 10.3% | 7.0% |
| Education | $36,600 | 6.9% | 6.5% |
| Liberal Arts | $30,150 | 8.2% | 6.7% |
| Philosophy/Religion | $28,500 | 30.0% | 9.5% |

**Key Insight:** Earnings matter more than debt. Philosophy graduates with $30k debt at $28.5k earnings face 14.1% debt-to-income ratio vs. Engineering at 7.5%.

## Proposed Solution

### Hybrid Risk-Adjusted Model

**Formula:**
```
Interest_Rate = Base_Rate + Risk_Premium - Income_Subsidy
```

**Parameters:**
- **Base Rate:** 5.00% (all students, down from current 5.50%)
- **Risk Premium:** 0% to +0.75% (half of actuarially fair)
- **Income Subsidy:** -0.50% to -2.00% (family income < $60k)
- **Effective Range:** 3.00% to 5.75%

### Examples

| Scenario | Base | Risk | Subsidy | Final Rate | Monthly ($30k) |
|----------|------|------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Engineering, High Income** | 5.00% | +0.17% | 0% | 5.17% | $322 |
| **Engineering, Low Income** | 5.00% | +0.17% | -1.00% | 4.17% | $307 |
| **Philosophy, High Income** | 5.00% | +0.75% | 0% | 5.75% | $330 |
| **Philosophy, Low Income** | 5.00% | +0.75% | -1.90% | 3.85% | $301 |

**Net Effect:** Low-income Philosophy students pay **LESS** than high-income Engineering students under hybrid model.

## Institution Quality Adjustments

### Carnegie & Selectivity Multipliers

**Risk adjustments based on institutional characteristics:**

| Institution Type | Example | Multiplier | Effect on Default |
|-----------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| R1 + Most Selective + Private | MIT Engineering | 0.40x | 5.2% → 2.1% |
| Master's + Moderate + Public | State University | 0.90x | 5.2% → 4.7% |
| Associate's + Open + Public | Community College | 1.32x | 5.2% → 6.9% |
| Baccalaureate + Low + For-Profit | For-Profit | 2.18x | 5.2% → 11.3% |

**Policy Implication:** Institution quality matters as much as field choice. For-profit engineering has higher risk than nonprofit liberal arts.

## Budget Analysis

### Revenue Neutrality

**Current System (2024):**
- Borrowers: 43 million
- Average balance: $37,000
- Total outstanding: $1.6 trillion
- Annual defaults: ~$10B
- Subsidy cost: $50B+ over 10 years

**Proposed System:**
- Increased revenue from high-risk borrowers: +$1.2B/year
- Decreased revenue from low-risk borrowers: -$0.8B/year
- Reduced defaults (better signaling): -$2-3B/year
- **Net effect: +$2.4-3.4B/year savings**

### Distribution of Winners/Losers

**Winners (lower rates):**
- 55% of borrowers (STEM, Business, Health fields)
- All low-income students (regardless of field)
- Public institutions (vs. for-profit)

**Losers (higher rates):**
- 15% of borrowers (Liberal Arts, Humanities at for-profit institutions)
- High-income students in high-risk fields
- For-profit institutions (face market discipline)

**Neutral (±$5/month):**
- 30% of borrowers (middle-tier fields, average income)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pilot (Years 1-2)

**Scope:** Graduate/professional programs only (MBA, JD, MD, etc.)
- **Rationale:** Higher debt, clearer earnings, older borrowers
- **Size:** ~15% of annual loan volume ($20B)
- **Risk:** Limited if pilot fails

**Example Graduate Pricing:**
| Program | Debt | Earnings | Current Rate | Proposed Rate | Difference |
|---------|------|----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| MD | $200k | $220k | 6.54% | 7.05% | +0.51 pp |
| JD | $145k | $85k | 6.54% | 7.58% | +1.04 pp |
| MBA | $66k | $95k | 6.54% | 7.76% | +1.22 pp |
| MFA | $58k | $48k | 6.54% | 8.85% | +2.31 pp |

### Phase 2: Expansion (Years 3-5)

**Scope:** All undergraduate programs
- Introduce risk premiums gradually (0.25 pp/year)
- Phase in income subsidies simultaneously
- Monitor enrollment effects by field
- Adjust based on Phase 1 learnings

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (Year 6+)

**Scope:** All federal student loans
- Dynamic pricing updated annually
- Integration with IBR plans
- Real-time default risk dashboards
- Institution accountability metrics

## Addressing Concerns

### Concern 1: "Discourages Liberal Arts"

**Response:**
- Liberal arts graduates provide social value beyond earnings (teachers, social workers, non-profit sector)
- **Solution:** Expand Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for mission-driven careers
- **Income subsidies** specifically protect low-income liberal arts students
- **Evidence:** Australia implemented similar system with minimal enrollment changes

### Concern 2: "Reinforces Inequality"

**Response:**
- Current system **already** has inequality (hidden cross-subsidies)
- Low-income students disproportionately attend for-profit institutions with 24% default rates
- **Proposed model explicitly addresses SES** via progressive subsidies
- Net effect: Low-income students in all fields pay less

### Concern 3: "18-Year-Olds Can't Assess Risk"

**Response:**
- Agreed—which is why transparency is critical
- **Require disclosure:** Show estimated monthly payment before enrollment
- **Counseling:** Mandatory financial literacy training
- **Guardrails:** Cap debt-to-expected-earnings at 1.5x

### Concern 4: "Gaming by Institutions"

**Response:**
- Institutions might discourage high-risk fields or manipulate data
- **Countermeasures:**
  - Use lagged data (3-year average) to prevent manipulation
  - Audit outliers (e.g., sudden completion rate jumps)
  - Tie Title IV eligibility to honest reporting
  - Independent verification via IRS wage data

## Comparison to Current Proposals

| Proposal | Our Model | Warren (Debt Cancellation) | Biden (Income-Based) | GOP (Full Privatization) |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Cost** | Revenue-neutral | $1.6T | $400B | $0 |
| **Equity** | Progressive subsidies | Universal benefit (regressive) | Caps at % income | No protection |
| **Efficiency** | Price signals | No signals | Weak signals | Strong signals |
| **Feasibility** | High (incremental) | Low (political) | Medium (regulatory) | Low (political) |

**Our model combines efficiency (GOP) with equity (Democrats) via hybrid approach.**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (2025)

1. **Commission CBO scoring** of hybrid model (revenue, distribution, behavioral effects)
2. **Stakeholder engagement:** College presidents, student groups, congressional leaders
3. **Data infrastructure:** Link College Scorecard to IRS earnings data for validation
4. **Legal review:** Confirm statutory authority under Higher Education Act

### Short-Term (2026-2027)

1. **Launch graduate pilot** with 3-5 partner institutions
2. **Public awareness campaign:** "Know Before You Borrow" with risk calculators
3. **Congressional hearings:** Build bipartisan support
4. **Regulatory rulemaking:** Propose changes to federal loan regulations

### Long-Term (2028+)

1. **Scale to undergraduates** based on pilot results
2. **International benchmarking:** Learn from Australia, UK, Netherlands
3. **AI/ML enhancement:** Real-time risk models updated quarterly
4. **Labor market integration:** Link to BLS occupational projections

## Conclusion

The current federal student loan system cross-subsidizes high-risk fields at the expense of low-risk borrowers while failing to signal career relevance to students. Risk-based pricing with progressive income subsidies can improve efficiency and equity simultaneously.

**Key Benefits:**
- $2-3B annual savings from reduced defaults
- Better price signals for students choosing majors
- Market discipline for institutions offering high-risk programs
- Progressive subsidies protect low-income students
- Revenue-neutral to federal budget

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Start with graduate pilot to build evidence
- Strong income-based subsidies to maintain access
- Transparency via mandatory disclosure
- Regular recalibration based on outcomes

**Next Step:** Convene interagency working group (Education, Treasury, OMB, CEA) to develop implementation plan for 2026 budget cycle.
